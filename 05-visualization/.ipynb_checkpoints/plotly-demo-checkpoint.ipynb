    "# Interactive data visualization with Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook developed by Sam Maurer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plotly** is a company that makes a suite of tools for building interactive data visualizations. You can work with the visualizations inside notebooks, publish the notebooks for other people to manipulate, or even embed the visualizations in web pages. https://plot.ly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly tutorials: https://plot.ly/python/plotly-fundamentals/\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly API reference: https://plot.ly/python-api-reference/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib and Seaborn work by generating an image file representing your visualization. (It's a PNG by default.) **Plotly generates JavaScript and HTML code instead**, which are the same components that most interactive web pages use. This allows visualizations to be interactive, as you'll see below.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in more of the technical details: Plotly is first and foremost a *JavaScript* visualization library. The Python library generates a JSON representations of your chart, which is passed along to a different library for rendering. The rendered JavaScript is what's embedded in the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "How does it actually turn into an image? Plotly is built on top of a library called [D3](https://d3js.org) that provides low-level tools for creating data-driven web visualizations. So Plotly builds your chart out of D3 components, and then D3 generates dynamic SVG images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying Plotly widgets in GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "If you upload a notebook to GitHub, Matplotlib and Seaborn charts will show up automatically, because the image itself is embedded in the notebook file. Plotly charts will **not show up** -- the information is there, but GitHub doesn't render the JavaScript and HTML. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's an easy solution, though. The Jupyter team has a web tool that will fully render and display any notebook with a public URL: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org. So just copy a notebook's GitHub URL and paste it into that form, and you'll be able to use the Plotly widgets. (You can paste a Dropbox link, too!)"
